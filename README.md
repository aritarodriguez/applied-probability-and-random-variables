**Probability Simulations in R

This project explores the fundamentals of probability theory and random variables through practical simulations in R. It was developed as part of the Applied Data Science for Business Management certification to demonstrate key statistical and probabilistic concepts using reproducible code and visualizations.

**Topics Covered***

Random experiments (e.g., dice rolls)
Event operations and probability calculations
Theoretical vs. empirical probability
Discrete random variables and expected value
Variance, standard deviation, and the Law of Large Numbers
Real-world simulations (quality control, demand modeling, voting intention)
Probability visualizations using ggplot2

**
Tools and Libraries**

ggplot2 – visualization
dplyr – data manipulation
gridExtra – combining plots

**How to Run**

Open the script in RStudio.
Run each section sequentially to view calculations and generated plots.
Adjust simulation parameters (e.g., sample size, probabilities) to explore different outcomes.

**Output Examples**

Distribution of dice outcomes
Expected gains and losses from discrete events

Poisson-modeled product demand

Comparative probability plots
